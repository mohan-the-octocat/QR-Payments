# QR-Payments
QR Payments is a `fictitious` application repo that holds all the logic for the QR payments mobile app. We use this repo to show case the usage of GitHub's Project Planning functions

## Getting started
This repo, has no application code yet! 

But it does contain the scaffolding for how you can manage your Project planning needs using the [Agile Software Development Framework](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)

This sample is built using a combination of GH features
- [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
- [Issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository), 
- [Issue labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels), 
- [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
